Hi! This is my python to do list project using cloud9 IDE. It's my new love as it is fast and reliable. I do need internet connection though(well apparently...as it is in the clouds! ). I developed this simple application through the help of git version control, MongoDB and Flask Framework. And to host a cloud application, apparently I used Heroku. It takes a while to set it up as I kept running into "Applicaiton Error" issue with error H14, which is caused by the Procfile that aborts web processing on my local host. It was fixed through scaling the process type using "heroku ps:scale web=1"

This is an ongoing project and special credits to Douglass Starnes for posting the walk-through of developing python APP using cloud9 IDE and Flask Framework. 

This project is merely for outside-the-classroom practices purposes. Let me know if you want to collaborate
